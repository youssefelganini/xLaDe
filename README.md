**xLaDe** is an experimental Lean 4 ecosystem framework for studying tooling, workflows, governance, and policy enforcement in a controlled, reproducible environment. It is free and open-source software (FOSS), released under the GNU General Public License v3.0.

Unlike traditional Lean repositories that focus on formalizing mathematics or verifying individual algorithms, **xLaDe explores how Lean is used** at the *ecosystem level*:

- repository structure
- development workflows
- governance and policy enforcement
- experimentation with tooling and contributor practices

xLaDe does **not** modify the Lean kernel.
Instead, it provides a controlled, distribution-like environment around Lean with executable experiments, build modes, policies, metrics, and tooling.

## Vision

xLaDe aims to provide a **safe, structured, and reproducible laboratory** for experimenting with Lean ecosystem ideas that are difficult to evaluate directly in upstream repositories.

The long-term vision includes exploration of:
- human-friendly proof workflows
- improved onboarding and error understanding
- tooling and workflow experiments
- community-oriented development practices

xLaDe focuses strictly on **ecosystem-level concerns**, not language-level changes or kernel modification.

For motivation, see:
- [`docs/WHY_xLaDe.md`](docs/WHY_xLaDe.md)

---

## What xLaDe Is (and Is Not)

### xLaDe **IS**
- a Lean-based **ecosystem experimentation platform**
- a framework for **workflow, governance, and tooling research**
- a repository with **documented and enforced policies**
- a safe environment for experimentation **without upstream disruption**

### xLaDe **IS NOT**
- a new theorem prover
- a replacement for Lean
- a modified Lean kernel
- a mathlib-style library

## Build Modes

xLaDe supports **multiple build modes**, reflecting different user intents.

Defined under [`modes/`](modes/):

| Mode             | Description                               |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Onboarding**   | Learning-friendly, minimal enforcement    |
| **Experimental** | Enables ecosystem experiments             |
| **Stable**       | Conservative defaults and strict policies |

Modes may influence:

* which experiments are enabled
* policy enforcement behavior
* stability expectations

---

## Experiments

xLaDe treats **ecosystem ideas as first-class experiments**.

Each experiment:

* is isolated and reversible
* has explicit scope and lifecycle
* documents enforcement and evaluation

See:

* [`experiments/`](experiments/)
* [`experiments/EXPERIMENT_TEMPLATE.md`](experiments/EXPERIMENT_TEMPLATE.md)

---

## Metrics and Evaluation

xLaDe evaluates **ecosystem behavior**, not mathematical performance.

Metrics focus on:

* enforcement strength
* developer friction
* reversibility
* governance clarity

See:

* [`metrics/`](metrics/)
* [`metrics/summary.md`](metrics/summary.md)

---

## Governance and Policies

Governance in xLaDe is **explicit and enforceable**.

* Policies: [`policies/`](policies/)
* Enforcement scripts: [`scripts/`](scripts/)
* Automated checks: [`.github/workflows/`](.github/workflows/)

Kernel immutability is enforced via CI.

---

## Reproducible Builds

xLaDe provides **reproducible builds by default**:

* [`lean-toolchain`](lean-toolchain) pins Lean
* [`lakefile.lean`](lakefile.lean) defines the root package
* [`lake-manifest.json`](lake-manifest.json) locks dependencies

---

## Installation

See:

* [`INSTALL.md`](INSTALL.md)

---

## Using xLaDe

xLaDe provides a lightweight CLI. Run these from root directory:

```
./bin/xlade init
./bin/xlade mode experimental
./bin/xlade list experiments
./bin/xlade run EXP-001
```

See:

* [`docs/CLI_DEMO.md`](docs/CLI_DEMO.md)
* [`docs/END_TO_END_TRACE.md`](docs/END_TO_END_TRACE.md)

---

## Contributing

Contributions are warmly welcome and help improve the project.

See:

* [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md)
* [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

Contributions that modify the Lean kernel are **not accepted**.

## Project Status

xLaDe is **experimental**.

As of `v1.4.0`:

* The current primary focus is mirrors and decentralization
* Experiment metadata is collected at the repository level to support backward compatibility
* The CLI-based app is still unstable

xLaDe exists as a living laboratory for Lean ecosystem design.
