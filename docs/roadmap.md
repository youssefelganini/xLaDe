# xLaDe Roadmap: 

This document outlines the planned development arc for xLaDe from v1.5.0 to the v2.0.0 milestone.

xLaDe follows a research-first development philosophy: releases are
deliberate, documented, and honest about limitations. Not every release
will work perfectly — and that is by design.

One release per month.

---

## v1.5.0 — "The CLI Becomes Real"

**Expected Release — May 2026**

The release where xLaDe stops being a research document with Python
files next to it and became working software.

- 50-test pytest suite covering all CLI modules
- `pip install -e .` works — xlade is a proper installable command
- EXP-002 executes `check-kernel.sh` for real via subprocess
- EXP-003 (doc coverage) added and executable
- `metrics.json` written on every run, read by `xlade metrics` and `xlade status`
- `xlade metrics` shows aligned run history table with status symbols
- `xlade status` shows run summary with success/fail counts
- `errors.py` duplication removed
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` contact filled in
- `pyproject.toml` — proper Python packaging

---

## v1.6.0 — "Lean Works Here"

**Expected Release — June 2026**

**Theme:** Make Lean installation understandable and integrate it properly
with the Python CLI. Centralise all subprocess calls behind a clean module.

**Goals:**

- `xlade doctor` gives actionable guidance — exact commands to fix each
  missing tool, not just "lake not found"
- elan check added to `xlade doctor` with install instructions
- `xlade/core/lean.py` — clean Python module wrapping all subprocess calls
  to `lake` and `lean`, returning structured `LeanResult` dataclass
- `xlade/cli/run.py` — `_execute()` delegates to `lean.py`, no raw
  subprocess calls in CLI layer
- EXP-001 (Enforced Proof Review) executes for real when Lake is present
- 83-test suite — 33 new tests covering `lean.py` and updated doctor
- `INSTALL.md` rewritten — step-by-step elan → lean4 → lake for Linux,
  macOS, and Android (Termux)
- `docs/CLI_DEMO.md` rewritten — accurate command reference with real output
- `docs/END_TO_END_TRACE.md` rewritten — full session trace, all three
  experiments, real terminal output
- Verified working on Android aarch64 (Termux)

**Expected outcome:** A new contributor can follow the docs, install Lean,
and run all three experiments successfully.

## v1.7.0 — "Real World Use Trial"

**Expected Release — July 2026**

**Theme:** Map real Lean 4 ecosystem projects to experiments. Expect and
document failure honestly.

**Goals:**

- Research and document 2–3 real Lean 4 projects (e.g. PhysLean,
  CS Lean, community proof projects) as candidate experiments
- Write experiment READMEs framing each as a research question
  xLaDe can investigate
- Attempt basic integration — not full execution, but enough to understand
  where the boundaries are
- Document what breaks, why, and what would be needed to fix it
- This release is expected to partially fail — failures are the data

**Philosophy:** xLaDe is a research laboratory. Publishing honest failure
is a feature, not a bug. v1.7.0 exists to find the edges.

**Expected outcome:** 2–3 new experiments in draft/active state, at least
one partially working, with documented findings on the others.

---

## v1.8.0 — "Preservation and Compatibility"

**Expected Release — August 2026**

**Theme:** Metadata, compatibility matrices, and long-term preservation.

**Goals:**

- Expand `experiment.toml` schema with full compatibility metadata:
  validated Lean versions, known breakages, last-tested date
- Compatibility matrix document: which experiments work on which
  Lean versions
- `xlade check` reports compatibility warnings when current Lean
  version differs from experiment's validated version
- Address Lean 4's backward compatibility problem explicitly —
  `docs/REPRODUCIBILITY_AND_COMPATIBILITY.md` finally has tooling
  behind it
- Archive format defined for retired experiments — nothing deleted,
  everything traceable
- `lake-manifest.json` and `lean-toolchain` pinning formally
  documented as part of the reproducibility story

**Expected outcome:** Running an experiment on the wrong Lean version
produces a clear warning. Every experiment has a documented environment
it was validated against.

---

## v1.9.0 — "Production Documentation"

**Expected Release — September 2026**

**Theme:** Documentation rewritten to production standard.

**Goals:**

- Full installation guide tested on clean machines across platforms
- Every CLI command documented with real examples and expected output
- Architecture documentation reflects the actual codebase
- `docs/` reorganised for clarity — onboarding path clearly marked
- `HOW_TO_READ_THIS_REPO.md` updated to reflect v1.9.0 reality
- CHANGELOG for all releases cleaned up and consistent

**Philosophy:** Docs written after the software stabilises are accurate.
Docs written before go stale. v1.9.0 is the right time.

**Expected outcome:** A new Lean researcher can read the docs, understand
what xLaDe is for, install it, and run their first experiment without
asking anyone for help.

---

## v2.0.0 — "Trust and Identity"

**Expected Release — October 2026**

**Theme:** Not a feature release. A trust, governance, and identity release.
xLaDe declares itself a serious long-term project.

### Two changes only:

**1. Signed Commits — Mandatory**

- GPG signing required for all commits to main from v2.0.0 onward
- Each contributor and maintainer holds their own GPG key
- Public keys published and verifiable
- GitHub branch protection enforces signed commits
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` documents GPG setup for new contributors
- `security/KEY_MANAGEMENT.md` documents who holds what keys and
  recovery procedures

**2. Official Website — Primary Entry Point**

- The Tor onion service becomes the true primary interface
- Website actively maintained: release notes published there first,
  documentation lives there, project status visible
- GitHub and all mirrors become secondary — development and contribution
  infrastructure, not the canonical public face
- Onion private key held by project lead and CEO, with documented
  offline backup and recovery procedure
- `OFFICIAL_SOURCES.md` updated to reflect the new hierarchy

---

## Notes

- The roadmap is intentionally flexible and research-driven
- Community feedback and experimental results guide prioritisation
- A new roadmap (v2.0.0 to v3.0.0) will be written after v2.0.0 ships
- For long-term vision beyond v2.0.0, see [`research_roadmap.md`](research_roadmap.md)

*not to promise it will arrive on schedule.*
